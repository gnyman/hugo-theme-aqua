# Weekend Project: Building a Photo Gallery

I spent this weekend building a simple photo gallery web app, and it turned out to be more fun (and educational) than I expected!

## The Idea

I wanted a clean, simple way to display my photography without relying on social media platforms. Something lightweight but elegant.

## Tech Stack

I kept it simple:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend
- **Node.js** for a basic server
- **Sharp** for image processing
- **Lightbox** for the gallery experience

## What I Learned

**Image optimization** is crucial. My original photos were 5MB+ each, which would have made the gallery unusable. Sharp helped me create responsive thumbnails and web-optimized versions.

**CSS Grid** is amazing for gallery layouts. With just a few lines of CSS, I got a responsive masonry-style layout that works on all screen sizes.

**Progressive loading** makes a huge difference. Loading thumbnails first and high-res images on demand keeps the initial page load snappy.

## Next Steps

I'm thinking about adding:
- Metadata display (camera settings, location)
- Basic categorization
- A simple admin interface for uploads

## The Code

The whole project is pretty compact - maybe 200 lines of code total. Sometimes the simple solutions are the best ones.

Have you built any fun weekend projects lately? I'd love to hear about them!
