# My Favorite Development Tools

As a developer, having the right tools can make all the difference in productivity and code quality. Here are some of my current favorites:

## Code Editors

**VS Code** has become my go-to editor for most projects. The extension ecosystem is incredible, and the integrated terminal saves me countless context switches.

**Vim** still has a special place in my heart for quick edits and remote work. The modal editing paradigm is unmatched for efficiency once you get the hang of it.

## Version Control

**Git** is obviously essential, but I've been really enjoying **lazygit** for a more visual interface when dealing with complex merge scenarios.

## Terminal Tools

- **zsh with oh-my-zsh** - Great shell with useful plugins
- **ripgrep** - Blazingly fast search tool
- **bat** - A better `cat` with syntax highlighting
- **exa** - Modern replacement for `ls`
