RSS (Really Simple Syndication) lets you follow new posts from this site in the feed reader of your choice. Instead of refreshing the inbox view, your reader checks the feed and surfaces unread entries automatically.

## Subscribe directly

- Main feed: [`/feed.xml`](/feed.xml)
- JSON feed: [`/feed.json`](/feed.json)

Copy one of the links above into your reader. Most apps recognise the `feed.xml` address instantly.

## Suggested readers

If you are on a Mac or iOS device (keeping with the Aqua-era spirit), these long-standing readers still feel right at home:

- **NetNewsWire** – open source, fast, and lovingly Mac-like.
- **Reeder** – polished iOS and macOS client with modern sync services.
- **ReadKit** – combines RSS, read-it-later, and newsletters.
- **Vienna** – classic open source reader for macOS.

Cross-platform or web-based options:

- **Feedbin** – web reader with email newsletter support and an excellent iOS app.
- **Inoreader** – powerful filtering and organisation for heavy feed users.
- **NewsBlur** – trainable filters and social sharing.
- **Tiny Tiny RSS** / **Miniflux** – self-hosted for complete control.

Need a hand getting started? Most readers offer an “Add Feed” or “Subscribe” button—paste the feed URL there. Once subscribed, new posts from this site will appear alongside the rest of your reading list.
